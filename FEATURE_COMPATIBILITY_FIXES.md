# Feature Compatibility Fixes for Lhydra Hybrid Music Recommender

## Issue Overview

The Lhydra Hybrid Recommender System was experiencing poor evaluation performance due to inconsistencies between the features used during training and evaluation. The model expected specific feature dimensions (56 user features and 25 item features), but the evaluation data contained different feature sets (76 user features and 23 item features). This led to features being truncated or padded in an ad-hoc manner, resulting in zero precision/recall/F1 scores.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Feature Manifest System**

   - Created a feature manifest system that records the exact features used during training
   - Added methods to check feature compatibility between training and evaluation data
   - Implemented feature alignment to ensure consistency in the feature sets

2. **Modified Data Preprocessor (`MusicDataPreprocessor`)**

   - Added `create_feature_manifest()` method to record all feature information
   - Added `save_feature_manifest()` method to save the manifest as YAML
   - Added `check_feature_compatibility()` method to validate data against the manifest
   - Updated `preprocess_pipeline()` to create and save the manifest

3. **Enhanced Model (`TwoTowerHybridModel`)**
   - Updated `save()` method to include the feature manifest
   - Enhanced `load()` method to load the feature manifest
   - Added `align_features()` method to align features based on the manifest
   - Modified `forward()` to use the feature alignment process

## Improvements

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Reproducibility**: The exact features used during training are now documented
2. **Consistency**: The evaluation pipeline now uses the same features as training
3. **Transparency**: Feature mismatches are clearly identified and reported
4. **Robustness**: Missing features are handled gracefully instead of causing errors
5. **Performance**: Evaluation results should now reflect true model performance

## Usage

### Training

During training, the feature manifest is automatically created and saved alongside the model:

```python
# Training will now automatically create and save the feature manifest
train_df, val_df, test_df = preprocessor.preprocess_pipeline(file_path, save_dir="data/preprocessed")
```

### Evaluation

During evaluation, load the model with the manifest to ensure feature compatibility:

```python
# Load model with feature manifest
model = TwoTowerHybridModel.load(
    model_path,
    manifest_path="data/preprocessed/feature_manifest.yaml"
)

# The model will now automatically align features during forward passes
```

## Feature Alignment Process

1. During data preprocessing, the system catalogs all features:

   - User features are grouped into demographic, listening, and audio preference categories
   - Item features are grouped into audio, genre, and temporal categories

2. During model saving/loading:

   - The model saves/loads the feature manifest along with model weights
   - Feature dimensions are validated against the model architecture

3. During inference:
   - The `align_features()` method filters input features to match expected features
   - Missing features are filled with zeros
   - Extra features are discarded
   - The correctly aligned features are passed to the model towers

## How to Check for Compatibility Issues

Use the `check_feature_compatibility()` method to validate data against the manifest:

```python
compatibility_report = preprocessor.check_feature_compatibility(test_df, manifest)
if not compatibility_report["is_compatible"]:
    print(f"Compatibility issues: {compatibility_report['issues']}")
    print(f"Missing user features: {compatibility_report['missing_user_features']}")
    print(f"Missing item features: {compatibility_report['missing_item_features']}")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Data Reprocessing**: Consider reprocessing all data to ensure consistent feature sets
2. **Model Retraining**: Retrain the model with the aligned features
3. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Update the evaluation script to explicitly use feature manifests
4. **Monitoring**: Add feature compatibility checks to the monitoring system
